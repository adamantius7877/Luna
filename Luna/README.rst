Purpose:
--------
Luna stands for Lexical Universal Natural Assistant.   The goal of this project is
to make it easier to work with technology, handle tedious tasks, and get general help
with anything able to be helped.  In the end the idea is that this will be an always
on application running on multiple devices, synchronizing and communicating in real time,
to accomplish tasks such as home automation, general secretarial duties, monitor vitals, 
display anything from one device on another device, utilize hardware from one device on
another, and a monsterous amount of other things.

Background:
-----------
The inspiration for this project came from Jarvis from Iron Man and 
the strong desire to automate as many tasks as possible to free up
our own time to do the things we love.

Designs/Concepts/Ideas:
-----------------------
It will use a unique node design approach where a node comes online and looks for a server, 
if no server is running then it starts running as a server itself.  If at any point 
a server goes down, a client will then take on the role of the server.  This means there 
will be server modes since a client could be on a phone, raspberry pi, laptop, desktop, 
etc.  So the "server" portion will do as much as it can on the device it is on.
