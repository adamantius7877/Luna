We first start by getting the project from git
git clone https://github.com/adamantius7877/luna

Then we proceed to move into the directory
cd luna

Run the correct script for your operating system
./install/ubuntu.sh

There should be a luna file that, for linux, you will need to copy to a directory in your path.  I will probably have the installation file copy it to /usr/bin by default unless otherwise requested not to.
